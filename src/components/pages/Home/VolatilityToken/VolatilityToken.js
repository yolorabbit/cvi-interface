                <p>
                    Volatility tokens bring a new and innovative concept for trading volatility while making the CVI eco-system composable with the greater DeFi ecosystem. <br/><br/>
                    The architecture is based on the first of their kind - funding fee adjusted leveraged rebased volatility tokens. The token is adjusted by funding fees and is being rebased to keep it pegged to the index. <br/><br/>
                    In addition, arbitrageurs can mint and burn tokens, thereby causing the price on decentralized exchanges to follow the token's intrinsic value in the CVI platform. <br/><br/>
                    â€ŒBy combining these two methods, the volatility tokens remain pegged to the index over time, allowing any user to buy and sell the tokens on secondary markets, such as Uniswap/Sushiwap/Quickswap. <br/><br/>
